# MediaApp
An Android App developed just for fun

This App is developed with Java and Android Studio. It uses Firebase as its underlying back-end server.

The App uses its Authentication system, login system and real-time database.

It scrapes data from IMDB and stores them in the database and displays them in the app. That's it.
